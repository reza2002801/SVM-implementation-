# ðŸ“Š SVM Implementation - Max Margin Classifier along y-axis

Welcome to my SVM (Support Vector Machine) implementation project! This project aims to illustrate the power of SVM by demonstrating how to find the maximum margin separator along the y-axis using [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org). 

The SVM model is a powerful supervised machine learning model widely used for classification and regression analysis. This specific implementation emphasizes on its classification capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to:

- Demonstrate the concept of SVM in a simple and understandable way.
- Implement an SVM model using cvxpy, a python library for optimization problems.
- Find the maximum margin separating hyperplane along the y-axis in a given dataset.

## ðŸ›  Installation Guidelines

Our project heavily relies on cvxpy, here is how to get started:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system. If not, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the project's main dependency, cvxpy, using pip:

    ```markdown
    pip install cvxpy
    ```
3. Clone this repository to your local machine, navigate into the project directory.

4. Run the script using Python:

    ```markdown
    python3 svm_implementation.py
    ```

## ðŸ“– Usage

Prepare your dataset and provide it to the script as the input. The script would return the maximum margin separating hyperplane along the y-axis.
